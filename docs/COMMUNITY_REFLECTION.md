# Community Building Reflection – Sprint 3

## 1. What We Did and Why
We created HPC setup and contributor documentation to help new team members and collaborators use pyARM easily.  
This supports our migration to the HPC system and ensures future contributors can reproduce the workflow.

**Goal:** Strengthen the contributor community by reducing setup barriers.

---

## 2. Which Community It Serves
This mainly serves the **contributor community**, but also benefits users running pyARM analyses.

---

## 3. Observed Impact
- Team members successfully accessed `/projects/earm`.  
- Documentation unified environment setup.  
- Reduced confusion on dependency installation and path setup.

---

## 4. Lessons Learned
- HPC systems differ — path consistency and permissions matter most.  
- Shared test scripts speed up debugging.  
- Clear docs are as valuable as working code.

---

## 5. Next Steps
1. Add GitHub issue templates.  
2. Publish docs via GitHub Pages.  
3. Invite new contributors to document their own HPC notes.

---

## 6. Summary
This sprint laid the foundation for collaboration.  
Clear setup steps + testing tools increase confidence.  
Future focus: communication, documentation, and inclusivity in pyARM.
