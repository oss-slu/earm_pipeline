I am closely working with the tech lead to install the necessary dependencies and set up the pyARM pipeline for high-throughput screening of photoreceptor mutants. The following tasks have been completed:

Created the Python environment and installed required packages (e.g., numpy, propka, mdanalysis).

Installed VMD and Orient (GUI + CLI) as per project requirements.

Set up GROMACS 4.5.7 and pdb2pqr 2.1.1.

Configured the arm_config.yaml file with necessary paths.

Verified that the core Python packages and computational tools are functional. and the Dowser source code to complete the setup. Once received, we will finalize the configuration and test workflows.
